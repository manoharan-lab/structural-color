        Calculates local x and y polarization rotated in reference frame where
        initial polarization is x-polarized. Assumes the incident light is in
        +z direction

        Within one trajectory, fields is accounted for by calculating
        the form factor using Mie theory, which gives the scattered fields
        and phase.

        To calculate the effects of interference between different
        trajectories, we include the phase shift calculated from Mie theory, as
        well as the phase shift due to the distances travelled. The structure
        factor contribution comes in through the phase shift due to the
        distances travelled.

        Here is an outline of how it is implemented:

        We start by calculating the amplitude scattering matrix in the
        parallel/perpendicular basis. We then multiply the matrix by the
        initial fields. This gives the scattered fields purely due to
        the form factor.

        Then we add these phase shifts to the phase shift incurred due to
        distance travelled, calculated as k*distance.

        We then rotate these phase values into local x and y coordinates,
        and after that, rotate them into global x, y, and z coordinates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        theta: 2d array
            Theta angles.
        phi: 2d array
            Phi angles.
        sintheta, costheta, sinphi, cosphi : array_like
            Sines and cosines of scattering (theta) and azimuthal (phi) angles
            sampled from the phase function. Theta and phi are angles that are
            defined with respect to the previous corresponding direction of
            propagation. Thus, they are defined in a local spherical coordinate
            system. All have dimensions of (nevents, ntrajectories).
        n_particle: float
            Index of refraction of particle.
        n_sample: float
            Index of refraction of sample.
        radius: float
            Radius of particle.
        wavelen: float
            Wavelength.
        step: ndarray (structcol.Quantity [length])
            Step sizes of packets (sampled from scattering lengths).
        volume_fraction: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
            Volume fraction of the sample.
        fine_roughness: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
            Fraction of the sample area that has fine roughness. Should be
            between 0 and 1. For ex, a value of 0.3 means that 30% of incident
            light will hit fine surface roughness (e.g. will "see" a Mie
            scatterer first). The rest of the light will see a smooth surface,

    Sets the trajectories' initial conditions (position, direction, weight,

    The initial positions are determined randomly in the x-y plane.

    If boundary is a sphere, the initial z-positions are confined to the

    If incidence_theta_min and incidence_theta_max are both set to 0, the

    * Notes:
    - for sphere boundary, incidence angle currently must be 0

    Parameters
    ----------
    nevents: int
        Number of scattering events
    ntraj: int
        Number of trajectories
    n_medium: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the medium.
    n_sample: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the sample.
    boundary: string
        Geometrical boundary for Monte Carlo calculations. Current options are
        'film' or 'sphere'
    rng: numpy.random.Generator object (default None) random number generator.
        If not specified, use the default generator initialized on loading the
        package
    incidence_theta_min: float (structcol.Quantity [angle])
        Minimum value for theta when it incides onto the sample.
        Should be >= 0 and < pi/2.
    incidence_theta_max: float (structcol.Quantity [angle])
        Maximum value for theta when it incides onto the sample.
        Should be >= 0 and < pi/2.
    incidence_theta_data: array (structcol.Quantity [angle]) (optional)
        Array of values for the incident theta for each trajectory. Length of
        the array must therefore be the same as number of trajectories. If
        None, the code will randomly sample theta angles from a uniform
        distribution between incidence_theta_min and incidence_theta_max. If
        user does not specify units, values must be in radians.
    incidence_phi_min: float (structcol.Quantity [angle])
        Minimum value for phi when it incides onto the sample.
        Should be >= 0 and <= pi.
    incidence_phi_max: float (structcol.Quantity [angle])
        Maximum value for phi when it incides onto the sample.
        Should be >= 0 and <= pi.
    incidence_phi_data: array (structcol.Quantity [angle]) (optional)
        Array of values for the incident phi for each trajectory. Length of
        the array must therefore be the same as number of trajectories. If
        None, the code will randomly sample phi angles from a uniform
        distribution between incidence_phi_min and incidence_phi_max.  If
        user does not specify units, values must be in radians.
    plot_initial: boolean
        If plot_initial is set to True, function will create a 3d plot showing
        initial positions and directions of trajectories before entering the
        sphere and directly after refraction correction upon entering the
        sphere.
    spot_size: float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        For film sample, side length of a square spot size. For sphere sample
        diameter of a circular spot size.
    sample_diameter: None or float (None type or structcol.Quantity [length])
        Diameter of the sample. Default is None. Should be None if sample
        geometry is a film. Should be float equal to the sphere diameter if
        sample is a sphere.
    coarse_roughness : float (can be structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Coarse surface roughness should be included when the roughness is large
        on the scale of the wavelength of light. This means that light
        encounters a locally smooth surface that has a slope relative to the
        z=0 plane. Then the model corrects the Fresnel reflection and
        refraction to account for the different angles of incidence due to the
        roughness. The coarse_roughness parameter is the rms slope of the
        surface. If included, it should be larger than 0. There is no upper
        bound, but when the coarse roughness tends to infinity, the surface
        becomes too "spiky" and light can no longer hit it, which reduces the
        reflectance down to 0.
    fields: boolean
        If True, also returns the initial fields of trajectories
    coherent: boolean
        If True, assumes the intial relative phases between trajectories are
        zero. If coherent is set to True while fields is set to False, then the
        coherent value is ignored, since there can be no coherence without
        taking into account the fields.

    Returns
    -------
    r0: 3D array-like (structcol.Quantity [length])
        Trajectory positions. Has shape of (3, number of events + 1, number of
        trajectories). r0[0,0,:] contains random x-positions within a circle on
        the x-y plane whose radius is the sphere radius. r0[1, 0, :] contains
        random y-positions within the same circle on the x-y plane. r0[2, 0, :]
        contains z-positions on the top hemisphere at the sphere boundary. The
        rest of the elements are initialized to zero.
    k0: 3D array-like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Initial direction of propagation. Has shape of (3, number of events,
        number of trajectories). k0[0,:,:] and k0[1,:,:] are initalized to
        zero, and k0[2,0,:] is initalized to 1.
    weight0: 3D array-like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Initial weight. Has shape of (number of events, number of trajectories)
        - Note that the photon weight represents the fraction of that
        particular photon that is propagated through the sample. It does not
        represent the photon's weight relative to other photons. the weight0
        array is initialized to 1 because you start with the full weight of the
        initial photons. If you wanted to make the relative weights of photons
        different, you would need to introduce a new variable (e.g relative
        intensity) that me, NOT change the intialization of the weights array.
        - Also Note that the size of the weights array it nevents*ntraj, NOT
        nevents+1, ntraj. This may at first seem counterintuitive because
        physically, we can associate a weight to a photon at each position
        (which would call for a dimension nevents+1), not at each event.
        However, there is no need to keep track of the weight at the first
        event; The weight, by definition, must initially be 1 for each photon.
        Adding an additional row of ones to this array would be unecessary and
        would contribute to less readable code in the calculation of
        absorptance, reflectance, and transmittance. Therefore the weights
        array begins with the weight of the photons after their first event.
    pol0: (optional) 3D array-like (structcol.Quantity[dimensionless])
        Initial polarization vector in global coordinates. Has shape of
        (number of events, number of trajectories). Only returns initial
        linearly, x-polarized light.
    kz0_rot : array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Initial z-directions that are rotated to account for the fact that
        coarse surface roughness changes the angle of incidence of light. Thus
        these are the incident z-directions relative to the local normal to the
        surface. The array size is (1, ntraj). Only returned if
        coarse_roughness is set to > 0.
    kz0_refl : array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        z-directions of the Fresnel reflected light after it hits the sample
        surface for the first time. These directions are in the global
        coordinate system. The array size is (1, ntraj). Only returned if
        coarse_roughness is set to > 0.

    """
    Calculates the phase function and scattering coefficient from either the
    single scattering model or Mie theory. Calculates the absorption
    coefficient from Mie theory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radius : float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        Radius of scatterer.
    n_particle : float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless] or
        structcol.refractive_index object)
        Refractive index of the particle.
    n_sample : float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless] or
        structcol.refractive_index object)
        Refractive index of the sample.
    volume_fraction : float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Volume fraction of the sample.
    wavelen : float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        Wavelength of light in vacuum.
    radius2 : float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        Mean radius of secondary scatterer. Specify only if the system is
        binary, meaning that there are two mean particle radii (for example,
        one small and one large).
    concentration : 2-element array (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Concentration of each scatterer if the system is binary. For
        polydisperse monospecies systems, specify the concentration as
        [0., 1.]. The concentrations must add up to 1.
    pdi : 2-element array (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Polydispersity index of each scatterer if the system is polydisperse.
        For polydisperse monospecies systems, specify the pdi as a 2-element
        array with repeating values (for example, [0.01, 0.01]).
    polydisperse : bool
        If True, it uses the polydisperse form and structure factors. If set to
        True, radius2, concentration, and pdi must be specified.
    fields: bool
        If True, returns phase function as function of theta and phi, so
        it can be used in field calculations
    fine_roughness: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        When the sample has surface roughness that is comparable to the
        wavelength of light, then the first step is calculated with Mie theory
        because light "sees" the Mie scatterer first instead of the sample as a
        whole. After taking the first step, light is inside the sample and is
        scattered in in the usual way, with the phase function based on the
        effective medium approximation. This parameter should be between 0 and
        1 and corresponds to the fraction of the sample area that has fine
        roughness. For ex, a value of 0.3 means that 30% of incident light will
        hit fine surface roughness (e.g. will "see" a Mie scatterer first). The
        rest of the light will see a smooth surface, which could be flat or
        have coarse roughness (long in the lengthscale of light).
    min_angle: float
        min_angle to prevent error because structure factor is zero at theta=0
    num_angles: int
        Sets the number of thetas at which phase function p will be calculated.
    num_phis: int
        Sets the number of phis at which phase function p will be calculated.
        Only used if polarization is True.
    structure_type: string or None
        structure factor desired for calculation. Can be 'glass',
        'paracrystal', 'polydisperse', 'data', or None.
    form_type: string or None
        form factor desired for calculation. Can be 'sphere', 'polydisperse',
        or None.
    structure_s_data: None or 1d array
        if structure_type is 'data', the structure factor data must be provided
        here in the form of a one dimensional array
    structure_qd_array: None of 1d array
        if structure_type is 'data', the qd data must be provided here in the
        form of a one dimensional array
    n_matrix : float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless] or
        structcol.refractive_index object)
        Refractive index of the matrix. It must be specified when the fine
        roughness is > 0. When there is fine roughness, we assume that light
        goes from the index of the matrix to the index of the scatterer. Thus
        we assume that fine roughness particles are not embedded in an
        effective medium.

    Returns
    -------
    p : array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Phase function from either Mie theory or single scattering model.
    mu_scat : float or 2-element array (structcol.Quantity [1/length])
        Scattering coefficient from either Mie theory or single scattering
        model. When fine_roughness is larger than 0, mu_scat is a 2-element
        array, where the first element is the scattering coefficient from
        either Mie theory or single scattering model, and the second element is
        the scattering coefficient from Mie theory.
    mu_abs : float (structcol.Quantity [1/length])
        Absorption coefficient of the sample as an effective medium.

    Notes
    -----
    The phase function is given by:
        p = diff. scatt. cross section / cscat
    The single scattering model calculates the differential cross section and
    the total cross section. In a non-absorbing system, we can choose to
    calculate these from Mie theory:
        diff. scat. cross section = S11 / k^2
        p = S11 / (k^2 * cscat)

    '''
    Calculates new initial directions based on the coarse roughness of the
    sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k: 3D array-like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Directions of propagation. Has shape of (3, number of events,
        number of trajectories). k0[0,:,:] and k0[1,:,:] are initialized to
        zero, and k0[2,0,:] is initialized to 1.
    n_medium: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the medium.
    n_sample: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the sample.
    coarse_roughness : float (can be structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Coarse surface roughness should be included when the roughness is large
        on the scale of the wavelength of light. This means that light
        encounters a locally smooth surface that has a slope relative to the
        z=0 plane. Then the model corrects the Fresnel reflection and
        refraction to account for the different angles of incidence due to the
        roughness. The coarse_roughness parameter is the rms slope of the
        surface. If included, it should be larger than 0. There is no upper
        bound, but when the coarse roughness tends to infinity, the surface
        becomes too "spiky" and light can no longer hit it, which reduces the
        reflectance down to 0.
    boundary: string
        Geometrical boundary for Monte Carlo calculations. Current options are
        'film' or 'sphere.' Coarse roughness is currently only implemented for
        a film.

    Returns
    -------
    k0_rough: 3D array-like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Initial direction of propagation, corrected for coarse roughness.
    kz0_rot : array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Initial z-directions that are rotated to account for the fact that
        coarse surface roughness changes the angle of incidence of light. Thus
        these are the incident z-directions relative to the local normal to the
        surface. The array size is (1, ntraj). Only returned if
        coarse_roughness is set to > 0.
    kz0_refl : array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        z-directions of the Fresnel reflected light after it hits the sample
        surface for the first time. These directions are in the global
        coordinate system. The array size is (1, ntraj). Only returned if
