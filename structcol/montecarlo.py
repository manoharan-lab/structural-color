        Refractive index of the medium.
    n_sample: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless] or

        Refractive index of the sample.
    radius : float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        radius of spherical boundary
    p : array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Phase function from either Mie theory or single scattering model.
    mu_scat : float (structcol.Quantity [1/length])
        Scattering coefficient from either Mie theory or single scattering model.
    mu_abs : float (structcol.Quantity [1/length])
        Absorption coefficient from Mie theory.
    detection_angle: float
        Range of angles of detection. Only the packets that come out of the
        sample within this range will be detected and counted. Should be
        0 < detection_angle <= pi/2, where 0 means that no angles are detected,
        and pi/2 means that all the backscattering angles are detected.
    plot_exits: boolean
        If set to True, function will plot the last point of trajectory inside 
        the sphere, the first point of the trajectory outside the sphere,
        and the point on the sphere boundary at which the trajectory exits,

        initially being sent into the sphere or for the fresnel reflected (tir)
        trajectories that are trapped in the sphere. It's default value is

        recursively called for calculating the reflectance from fresnel 
        reflected trajectories
    run_tir: boolean
        If set to True, function will calculate new trajectories for weights 
        that are fresnel reflected back into the sphere upon exit (There is
        almost always at least some small weight that is reflected back into
        sphere). If set to False, fresnel reflected trajectories are evenly 
        distributed to reflectance and transmittance.       
    call_depth: int
        This argument is not intended to be set by the user. Call_depth keeps 
        track of the recursion call_depth. It's default value is 0, and upon
        each recursive call to calc_refl_trans_sphere(), it is increased by 1. 
    max_call_depth: int
        This argument determines the maximum number of recursive calls that can
        be made to calc_refl_trans_sphere(). The default value is 20, but it 
        can be changed by the user if desired. The user should note that there
        are diminishing returns for higher max_call_depth, as the remaining 
        fresnel reflected trajectories after 20 calls are primarily stuck in 
        shallow angle paths around the perimeter of the sphere that will never 
        exit.

        Fraction of transmitted trajectories, including the Fresnel correction
        but not considering the range of the detector.

        Radius of scatterer.
