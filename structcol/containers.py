This module creates containers classes for Monte Carlo simulations of 
multiple scattering. The containers are different types of geometric 
boundary conditions for the samples.

    Class that describes spherical boundary conditions for a sample. Depending
    on how it is utilized, the Sphere object can be either a solid particle or

    Attributes
    ----------
    radius: float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        Radius of the sphere.
    index: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the sphere. If the Sphere object contains an 
        arrangement of particles, then this refractive index corresponds to 
        the "matrix" in which the particles are embedded. 
    filling: None or object from arrangements module
        Interior of the Sphere object. If None, the Sphere object will be a 
        solid homogeneous sphere. Otherwise, it will be an arrangement (for 
        example, a Glass object consisting of a glassy assembly of 
        nanoparticles). Default is set to None.

    Class that describes multilayered boundary conditions for a sample,

    the center layer being the core. The simplest LayeredSphere object is a 
    core-shell particle. If the shells have the same refractive index as the

        layer will have a constant and homogeneous index. Otherwise, the layer
