    n_sample: float
        Refractive index of the sample

        array of event indices for transmitted trajectories
    refl_weights_pass: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        weights of reflected trajectories, corrected for fresnel reflection
        upon exit. Zero values indicate trajectory was totally internally
        reflected back into the sample, or not reflected in the first place
    trans_weights_pass: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        weights of transmitted trajectories, corrected for fresnel reflection
        upon exit. Zero values indicate trajectory was totally internally
        reflected back into the sample, or not transmited in the first place
    trajectories: Trajectory object
        Trajectory object used in Monte Carlo simulation
    boundary: string
        geometrical boundary, current options are 'film' or 'sphere'
    thickness: float
        thickness of film or diameter of sphere
    detection_angle: float
        largest trajectory angle that can be detected. Detection angle
        is defined relative to the z-axis and must be between 0 and pi/2.
        If 0, this means that the detection range is infinitesimal.
        If pi/2, all backscattering angles are detected.

        small number used to prevent a divide-by-zero error when calculating
        trans_det_frac and refl_det_frac
    kz0_rot : None or array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Initial z-directions that are rotated to account for the fact that
        coarse surface roughness changes the angle of incidence of light. Thus
        these are the incident z-directions relative to the local normal to the
        surface. The array size is (1, ntraj).
    kz0_refl : None or array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        z-directions of the Fresnel reflected light after it hits the sample
        surface for the first time. These directions are in the global
        coordinate system. The array size is (1, ntraj).

    """
    Calculates the weight fraction of reflected and transmitted trajectories
    (reflectance and transmittance).Identifies which trajectories are reflected
    or transmitted, and at which scattering event. Includes corrections for
    Fresnel reflections and for a detector.

    Parameters
    ----------
    trajectories : Trajectory object
        Trajectory object used in Monte Carlo simulation
    thickness: float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        thickness of film or diameter of sphere
    n_medium: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the medium.
    n_sample: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the sample.
    boundary: string
        Geometrical boundary for Monte Carlo calculations. Current options
        are 'film' or 'sphere'.
    z_low : float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        Initial z-position of sample closest to incident light source.
        Should normally be set to 0.
    detection_angle: float
        Range of angles of detection. Only the packets that come out of the
        sample within this range will be detected and counted. Should be
        0 < detection_angle <= pi/2, where 0 means that no angles are detected,
        and pi/2 means that all the backscattering angles are detected.
    n_front: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the front cover of the sample (default None)
    n_back: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the back cover of the sample (default None)
    p: array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Phase function from either Mie theory or single scattering model.
    return_extra: boolean
        determines whether to return a host of extra variables that are used
        for additional calculations using the trajectories
    run_fresnel_traj: boolean
        If set to True, function will calculate new trajectories for weights
        that are fresnel reflected back into the sphere upon exit (There is
        almost always at least some small weight that is reflected back into
        sphere). If set to False, fresnel reflected trajectories are evenly
        distributed to reflectance and transmittance.
    fresnel_traj: boolean
        This argument is not intended to be set by the user. Its purpose is to
        keep track of whether calc_refl_trans_sphere() is running for the
        trajectories initially being sent into the sphere or for the fresnel
        reflected (tir) trajectories that are trapped in the sphere. It's
        default value is False, and it is changed to True when
        calc_refl_trans_sphere() is recursively called for calculating the
        reflectance from fresnel reflected trajectories
    call_depth: int
        This argument is not intended to be set by the user. Call_depth keeps
        track of the recursion call_depth. It's default value is 0, and upon
        each recursive call to calc_refl_trans_sphere(), it is increased by 1.
    max_call_depth: int
        This argument determines the maximum number of recursive calls that can
        be made to calc_refl_trans_sphere(). The default value is 20, but it
        can be changed by the user if desired. The user should note that there
        are diminishing returns for higher max_call_depth, as the remaining
        fresnel reflected trajectories after 20 calls are primarily stuck in
        shallow angle paths around the perimeter of the sphere that will never
        exit.
    max_stuck:float
        The maximum weight of stuck trajectories to leave in the sample
        without creating new trajectories to rerun. This argument is only used
        if run_fresnel_traj is True.
    plot_exits: boolean
        If set to True, function will plot the last point of trajectory inside
        the sphere, the first point of the trajectory outside the sphere,
        and the point on the sphere boundary at which the trajectory exits,
        making one plot for reflection and one plot for transmission
    mu_scat : float (structcol.Quantity [1/length])
        Scattering coefficient from either Mie theory or single scattering
        model.
    mu_abs : float (structcol.Quantity [1/length])
        Absorption coefficient from Mie theory.
    detector: boolean
        Set to true if you want to calculate reflection while using a
        goniometer detector (detector at a specified angle).
        If True, must also specify det_theta, det_len, and det_dist.
    det_theta: float-like
        angle between the normal to the sample (-z axis) and the center of the
        detector
    det_len: float-like
        side length of the of the detector, assuming it is a square
    det_dist: float-like
        distance from the sample to the detector
    plot_detector: boolean
        if True, will plot refraction plots and exit and detected trajectories
    kz0_rot : None or array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Initial z-directions that are rotated to account for the fact that
        coarse surface roughness changes the angle of incidence of light. Thus
        these are the incident z-directions relative to the local normal to the
        surface. The array size is (1, ntraj).
    kz0_refl : None or array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        z-directions of the Fresnel reflected light after it hits the sample
        surface for the first time. These directions are in the global
        coordinate system. The array size is (1, ntraj).
    save_stuck_weights: boolean (optional)
        default is False. If set to True, saves a file with the stuck weight
        fraction. Useful for testing whether event number is sufficiently high.
    fine_roughness: TODO document argument
    n_particle: TODO document argument
    n_matrix: TODO document argument
    rng: numpy.random.Generator object (default None) random number generator.
        If not specified, use the default generator initialized on loading the
        package.  The RNG is needed only when run_fresnel_traj is True.

    Returns
    -------
    refl_trans_result: tuple
        contains a tuple of other variables. The contents of refl_trans_result
        are different based on whether return_extra is set to True or False.

        Returns if return_extra is False
        --------------------------------
        reflectance: float
            Fraction of reflected trajectories, including the Fresnel
            correction but not considering the range of the detector.
        transmittance: float
            Fraction of transmitted trajectories, including the Fresnel
            correction but not considering the range of the detector.

        Returns if return_extra is True
        -------------------------------
        (refl_indices, trans_indices, inc_refl_detected/ntraj,
        refl_weights_pass/ntraj, trans_weights_pass/ntraj, trans_frac,
        refl_frac, refl_fresnel/ntraj, trans_fresnel/ntraj, norm_vec_refl,
        norm_vec_trans, reflectance, transmittance)
            These variables can be used to do various extra calculations using
            the trajectories

    Note
    ----
        absorptance of the sample can be found by 1 - reflectance -
        transmittance

    For the sphere case, there are many trajectories that are totally
    internally reflected or partially reflected back into the sample

    This function takes the weights of the trajectory components reflected back
    into the sample (whether it's the whole weight through tir, or just partial
    through fresnel) and re-runs them as new trajectories, until most of them
    exit through reflectance, transmittance, or are absorbed. Note that it does
    not re-run stuck trajectories (trajectories that have not yet attempted an
    exit.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    refl_per_traj_nf: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        reflectance per trajectory, not counting trajectory weights fresnel
        reflected back into the sample
    trans_per_traj_nf: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        transmittance per trajectory, not counting trajectory weights fresnel
        reflected back into the sample
    refl_fresnel: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        weights of reflected trajectories that are fresnel reflected
        back into the sample
    trans_fresnel: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        weights of transmitted trajectories that are fresnel reflected back
        into the sample
    stuck_weights: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        weights of stuck trajectories
    trajectories: Trajectory object
        Trajectory object used in Monte Carlo simulation

        array of event indices for reflected trajectories
    trans_indices: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        array of event indices for transmitted trajectories
    tir_indices: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        array of event indices for totally internally reflected trajectories
    stuck_indices: 1d array (length: ntraj)
        array of event indices for stuck trajectories
    thickness: float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        thickness of film or diameter of sphere
    boundary: string
        Geometrical boundary for Monte Carlo calculations. Current options
        are 'film' or 'sphere'.
    z_low : float (structcol.Quantity [length])
        Initial z-position of sample closest to incident light source.
        Should normally be set to 0.
    p: array_like (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Phase function from either Mie theory or single scattering model.
    n_medium: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the medium.
    n_sample: float (structcol.Quantity [dimensionless])
        Refractive index of the sample.

        model.
    mu_abs : float (structcol.Quantity [1/length])
        Absorption coefficient from Mie theory.
    max_stuck:float
        The maximum weight of stuck trajectories to leave in the sample
        without creating new trajectories to rerun. This argument is only used
        if run_fresnel_traj is True.
    call_depth: int
        This argument is not intended to be set by the user. Call_depth keeps
        track of the recursion call_depth. It's default value is 0, and upon
        each recursive call to calc_refl_trans_sphere(), it is increased by 1.
    plot_exits: boolean
        If set to True, function will plot the last point of trajectory inside
        the sphere, the first point of the trajectory outside the sphere,
        and the point on the sphere boundary at which the trajectory exits,
        making one plot for reflection and one plot for transmission
    rng: numpy.random.Generator object (default None) random number generator.
        If not specified, use the default generator initialized on loading the
        package

    Returns
    -------
    reflectance_fresnel + reflectance_no_fresnel: float
        new reflectance after re-running fresnel reflected trajectories. Adds

        to the reflectance (reflectance_fresnel)
    transmittance_fresnel + transmittance_no_fresnel: float
        new transmittance after re-running fresnel reflected trajectories. Adds
        the previous transmittance (transmittance_no_fresnel) and the new
        addition to the transmittance (transmittance_fresnel)

def normalize_refl_goniometer(refl, det_dist, det_len, det_theta):
    '''
    calculates the reflectance renormalized for goniometer measurement

    This normalization scheme makes several key assumptions:
    (1) The area of the detection hemisphere spanned by the detector aperture
        is a square. As the detector size approaches the diameter of the
        detection hemisphere, this assumption becomes worse. In reality, the
        detection hemisphere area spanned by the detector is the projection of
        a square on the sphere surface, which looks like a curved square patch.
    (2) The reference reflector (maximum reflectance) is that of a lambertian
        reflector, meaning the reflectance is uniform over the detection
        hemisphere and that the integrated reflected intensity is equal to the
        intensity of the incident beam. This means that if the sample has a
        specular component, the reflectance could be greater than one for the
        specular angle.

    The normalization formula:

    refl_renormlized = ((area of detection hemisphere)/(area detected)
                        * reflectance)

    We are just scaling up the reflectance based on the area detected relative
    to the total possible area that can be detected.

    -----
    detection hemisphere: the hemisphere surrounding the sample, having radius
                          of the detector distance. In the case of reflectance
                          measurements, it is a reflection hemisphere.

    Calculates haze, the fraction of diffuse transmittance over total

    For diffuse transmittance, we use a cutoff of 4.5 degrees, meaning we
    call anything scattered more than 4.5 degrees from the forward direction
    diffuse transmittance. The 4.5 degree cuttoff comes from:
